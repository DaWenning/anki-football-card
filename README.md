### Compatibility

Anki 2.1.20 or higher is required for this add-on to work.

Cards created with this add-on can be reviewed with all Computer and mobile apps and on AnkiWeb.

### Usage

#### Creating / Editing

The note type is automatically added the first time you start Anki after installing the add-on.

When creating cards, write a "1" for correct choices or a "0" for incorrect choices in the "Answers" field.
The question type can be selected with the field "QType".
It can be either 0 (Kprim), 1 (Multiple Choice) or 2 (Single Choice).
The [Screenshots](#screenshots) section shows how the question types look.
These values in the "Answer" field must be separated by a single space.
The order and number of values in the "Answer" field must correspond with the choices "Q_1" to "Q_5".
If you don't need all the choices, just leave the remaining "Q_" fields blank and only enter as many values as you need in the "Answers" field.

#### Reviewing

The add-on will automatically style your choices based on whether you answered correctly or not.

Great work Simon!

[Hax](https://github.com/Schlauer-Hax) merged my Multiple Choice card template with Simon Lammer's persistence code.
He also reworked my card templates into one single all-in-one template.
Thanks a lot!

Simon's and Hax's work made the multiple choice cards compatible with all platforms.

Volker Umpfenbach contributed a change that allows to customize how the questions and answers are colorized.
He also provided the code to calculate and display the percentage of correctly answered items per question.
